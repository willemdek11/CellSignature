\usage{
corr_matrix_CellSignature(exp, sig, i, r)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{Dataframe of transcriptomic data (natural scale) containing genes as rows and samples as columns. Note: Gene names should be set as row names and duplicates are not allowed. Missing values are not allowed within the expression matrix. Check example- head(example_data): \code{\link{example_data}}.}

\item{r}{Use a value between 0 and 1. Default is 0.6. This is a user defined correlation cut-off to perform feature selection (\code{\link{feature_select}}). Feature selection aids to enrich the prediction of relative abundance of immune cells by filtering off poorly correlated ImSig genes. To get an idea of what cut-off to use check the results of (\code{\link{gene_stat}}) and choose a cut-off that displays high median correlation and maintains a high proportion of genes after feature selection.}
}
\value{
Gene-gene correlation matrix of ImSig genes.
}
\description{
Creates a correlation matrix of ImSig signature genes.
